      <description>Thank you for contributing! Pion is a community project, and only exists because of the hard work of many different people. Contributing doesn&amp;rsquo;t just involve code either, you can be involved in many different ways. Before starting here are some things to remember that will make the whole process a whole lot more fun and effective.
Everyone has different time constraints and schedules Don&amp;rsquo;t take it personally when your work doesn&amp;rsquo;t get reviewed or merged in a timely manner.</description>
