      <title>Pion WebRTC v2.0.0 Release Notes</title>
      <link>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/release-notes/webrtc-v2.0.0/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/release-notes/webrtc-v2.0.0/</guid>
      <description>The Pion team is very excited to annouce v2.0.0, our 4th release that includes 5th months of work! With this release we have lots of new features, performance improvements and bug fixes.
This release does introduce a few breaking changes. We had accumulated a fair amount of technical debt, and these changes were needed to allow us to move forward on things like ORTC and TURN.
Please read these changes carefully, most of these things aren&amp;rsquo;t caught at compile time and could save a lot of time debugging.</description>

      <description>This article covers the major components used in a WebRTC deployment. Please note that the article assumes you have a basic understanding of WebRTC. Consider reading trough the WebRTC Introduction if you are new to WebRTC.
Signaling server The first step in setting up a WebRTC connection is what&amp;rsquo;s known as signaling. This is en exchange of information needed to safely connect two peers to each other. The WebRTC API provides this data in a plain text a format known as SDP.</description>

      <description>Today we&amp;rsquo;ll walk through setting up a Data Channel connection in Go using pion/webrtc. Check out our knowledge base articles on WebRTC if you&amp;rsquo;re new to it. You can also skip to the full examples if you just want to look at the code.
Preparation Let&amp;rsquo;s quickly cover how to get started with pion/webrtc. If you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with Go you can skip to the next section. To start you can download the library using go get: go get github.</description>

      <title>WebRTC Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-basics/webrtc-everywhere/</link>

      <guid>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-basics/webrtc-everywhere/</guid>
      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at all the places you can run pion/webrtc.
Server The first use-case for a Go WebRTC library naturally is running WebRTC on the server. This enables you to connect to browsers and other WebRTC servers directly while punching through NATs. Because the Pion WebRTC stack is written completely in Go, you can run it anywhere Go runs. And that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of places, including: Linux, macOS and Windows on both x86 and ARM.</description>

      <guid>https://pion.ly/knowledge-base/pion-basics/why-pion/</guid>
      <description>&amp;lsquo;Why would I use Pion&amp;rsquo; this is the first question we get asked by potential users, and it is a great one. Learning new software is an investment, as developers we know how frustrating it can be when you make the wrong choice.
The answer is different depending on your needs. However it seems to always come down to a few major reasons. Here is what drives Pion, and why we think you should give us a try.</description>
