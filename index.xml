      <description>In this post we&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at all the places you can run pions/webrtc.
Server The first use-case for a Go WebRTC library naturally is running WebRTC on the server. This enables you to connect to browsers and other WebRTC servers directly while punching through NATs. Because the Pion WebRTC stack is written completely in Go, you can run it anywhere Go runs. And that&amp;rsquo;s a lot of places, including: Linux, MaxOS and Windows on both x86 and ARM.</description>

      <description>This article covers the major components used in a WebRTC deployment. Please note that the article assumes you have a basic understanding of WebRTC. Consider reading trough the WebRTC Introduction if you are new to WebRTC.
Signaling server The first step in setting up a WebRTC connection is what&amp;rsquo;s known as signaling. This is en exchange of information needed to safely connect two peers to each other. The WebRTC API provides this data in a plain text a format known as SDP.</description>

      <description>&amp;lsquo;Why would I use Pion&amp;rsquo; this is the first question we get asked, and it is a great one. It is a hard one to answer, and usually it is different depending on your needs. However it seems to always come down to a few major reasons.
Learning new software is an investment, as developers we know how frustrating it can be when you make the wrong choice. So here is what drives Pion, and why we think you should give us a try.</description>
